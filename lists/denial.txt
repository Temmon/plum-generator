I'm not saying no, but...
Hold up
Nah
Uh-uh
Yeah, no
Oh God, no
Yeah, right
Get lost
Give me a break
Forget it
Not hardly
Not a chance
No can do
No way in hell
Not on your life
You've got to be kidding me
Seriously?
I don't think so
We'll see
Excuse me?
Nope
Naw
Nuh-uh
How about no?
Hell no
You wish
Get out of here
Please
Absolutely not
Not even close
Not going to happen
No way
No fucking way
Not in a million years
Are you out of your mind?
I wish I could
Let me think about it
